## Notes

What is beyond the physical? Human experience is both physical and metaphysical. There are experiences that are difficult, if not impossible, to quantify. The social, economic, and political are intangible, abstract, symbolic, narrative, and experiential.

# Wikipedia: Spiral Dynamics

“Metamodernist philosophers Daniel Görtz and Emil Friis, writing as Hanzi Freinacht, praise the unique insights of Spiral Dynamics while also criticizing it for combining too many dimensions of development into one measurement. They have proposed a multi-part system combining aspects of Spiral Dynamics with other developmental measurements.”

# Whole World Weavers

I am grateful to have the opportunity to host our World Weavers conversation tomorrow.

We have been discussing different directions for our World Building community. Hannah is weaving together a network of regenerative projects and communities. Richard Ramsay suggested that we could reframe the World Wide Web of life as Whole World Weavers. So, we are evolving from World Building to World Weaving.

I am curious about how we can weave together the ideas, energy, and work of each individual into a synergetic whole.

As synergy is the behavior of wholes unpredicted by behavior of their parts, how does this synergy emerge?

Let’s co-create ways that we can navigate the future together as co-operators of Spaceship Earth.

If our world has been designed to divide us into political and ideological polarities, how might we heal the cultural divisions? Is there a way that we can recognize both the common ground of being members of a greater whole and the diversity of unique perspectives?

# Geometrical Psychology: Mathematical Models of Consciousness by the 19th-Century Psychologist Benjamin Betts

The symbolic forms which Mr. Betts has evolved through his system of Representation resemble, when developed in two dimensions, conventionalised but very scientifically and beautifully conventionalised leaf-outlines. When in more than two dimensions they approximate to the forms of flowers and crystals.

These mathematical curves might serve as a truer and more scientific basis of classification for Botany than de Candolle’s system or any other yet employed, many so-called amorphous developments of the Flora being readily reducible to law according to this method. For instance, the simple corollas, the horn-shaped corollas, and the bi-axial corollas would supply three main classes of flower forms, each of which might be divided into various distinct sub-classes.

The fact that he has accidentally portrayed plant-forms when he was studying human evolution is an assurance to Mr. Betts of the fitness of the symbols he has developed, as it affords presumptive evidence that the laws he is studying intuitively admit of universal application.

# Laura Anne Edwards

Laura is a systems thinker and speaker, with a deep background in media/tech/branding. She is most known for large interdisciplinary strategy and projects. She is passionate about democratizing access to capital and information/data, with particular focus on progress to support women, climate and the world’s toughest last-mile problems. Frequent topics she speaks on are: diversity of thought, the future of humans in space and the urgent need to design information systems that will grow with humanity.

Laura asked me a simple question this week. I didn’t know how to answer it. I have been in service of others for a very long time, seeking to please or to find a way to fit into the existing system, the status quo.

Realizing that I do not fit, I stopped trying to fit, and began exploring other ways of being.

The question Laura asked was, “What do you need?”

There is a cognitive bias that allows us to see the faults of others, but we tend to be blind to our own faults.

Jesus said, in effect, never mind the splinter in your brother’s eye. Focus on the log in your own eye.

> “Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.
> 
> “Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.
> 
> “Do not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.”

— Matthew 7:1-6

# Cognitive Biases

A cognitive bias is an inherent thinking ‘blind spot’ that reduces thinking accuracy and results in inaccurate—and often irrational—conclusions.

An Evangelical Christian, capitalist, and nationalist political movement spent the past half century formulating and implementing a strategy for a power play to assume authoritarian control over the democratic social, economic, and political systems of the United States of America.

A highly educated, liberal progressive movement, understanding from the study of philosophy, science, psychology, biology, and ecology that the dominant social, economic, and political systems of the globe are acting in ways that are at odds with the long-term survival of the living systems of the planet are struggling to understand how to maintain personal integrity while helping us all find a better way of knowing, being, and doing in the world that would benefit us all.

Having narrowly escaped the prospect of the largest military-industrial complex becoming the next fascist, authoritarian nation state—although you could argue that it has already become the thing we most feared—how do we navigate the turbulent waters ahead? What is our trimtab? How do we turn this ship around?

- What is the power of one individual to create change?
- What is the power of the collective to create change?
- What is the power of the universe to create change?

That is how I would like to frame the question.

# What do I need?

At the Living Systems Collaboratory, we have come to the end of the first phase of our coherence as a collective.

We will be presenting this weekend.

# John Crawford

- Time to reset
- Instead of telling people about what you have done or will be doing
- Tell yourself what you really need to do
- Our intellectual ego-based motivations are not the clearest indication of what we should be doing
- Share the discovery of what you need to be focusing on
